    "\n",
    "fMRI analysis often has a dimensionality problem: we get approximately 100,000 voxels (i.e., features) per volume, but only 100s of time points or trials (i.e., examples). This makes it very hard for machine learning algorithms to model how each voxel contributes. For more general information on this problem, also dubbed the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), see [these slides from the Texas A&M University Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/choe/11spring/633/lectures/slide08.pdf). For a neuroimaging-specific view on the curse of dimensionality, you might want to take a look at [Mwangi et al.'s Neuroinformatics review from 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040248/).\n",

    "**Dataset:** For this script we will use a localizer dataset from [Kim et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017) again. Just to recap: The localizer consisted of 3 runs with 5 blocks of each category (faces, scenes and objects) per run. Each block was presented for 15s. Within a block, a stimulus was presented every 1.5s (1 TR). Between blocks, there was 15s (10 TRs) of fixation. Each run was 310 TRs. In the matlab stimulus file, the first row codes for the stimulus category for each trial (1 = Faces, 2 = Scenes, 3 = Objects). The 3rd row contains the time (in seconds, relative to the start of the run) when the stimulus was presented for each trial.\n",

    "When we took a few PCA components instead of all voxels, we were performing feature selection. Feature selection is used to reduce noise and increase computational speed. However, a problem with the approach above is that feature selection is applied to all data (prior to division into training and test sets) and is thus a kind of double dipping.\n",

    "<strong>Aside:</strong>  While doing PCA on the whole dataset violates the principle of “never touch your test data during training”, researchers have sometimes used this approach, justifying it on the grounds that — while PCA is using the fMRI data from the test set — it is not peeking at the class labels from the test set, and thus it will not bias classification accuracy. Is this OK? It’s difficult to say *a priori*. It is always safer to completely avoid touching the test data during training, so you should do this if at all possible. If you aren’t sure what problems might emerge from a particular analysis method, a good check of your method is to test on random noise; when you do this, classification should not exceed chance (if it does, you have a problem…)\n",

You can learn more about the ANOVA here:  [ANOVA F-value](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html).
