    "# fMRI Data Loading and Normalization in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "In cognitive neuroscience, what was considered impossible a few decades ago is now doable. Today, we can infer certain aspects of a person's cognitive processes from measurements of brain activity. This progress has come about due to a confluence of improvements in three different areas: computing speeds, brain imaging methods, and efficient machine learning algorithms. To use all three of these aspects for our data analysis, in an optimal manner, involves learning a complex sequence of steps. Our overarching goal for these exercises is to provide a step-by-step walk-through on how to execute these analysis steps and infer cognitive states from brain activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process begins with running experiments and collecting fMRI data. Then, collected data undergo preprocessing, which involves corrections, transformations, and alignments. Only after these steps have been completed are the data ready for analysis by machine learning algorithms. Preprocessed fMRI data are commonly stored in the NIfTI format, the starting point for our analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, our aim is to cover the very first step in the analysis: the extraction and normalization of pre-processed fMRI data. We will use a localizer dataset from [Kim et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017). This dataset will heretofore be referred to as the \"vdc\" dataset. For the localizer, subjects were shown blocks of faces, scenes and objects in 3 separate runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you need help understanding terms such as \"localizer\", \"blocks\", \"runs\", please read the glossary below and also do some self-study on fMRI terminology. This [talk series](https://cbmm.mit.edu/fmri-bootcamp) is a great starting place. If you would like to learn more about fMRI preprocessing, you can find some useful lecture material here: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/ (scroll down to 'Lecture slides & Practical Data').\n",

    " 1. Load fMRI data into Python.\n",

    ">*stimulus*: The item that we wish to present to the participant in an experiment. Typically a picture or a sound. In the 'vdc' study, pictures of faces, places, and objects are shown to the participant.  \n",
    ">*trial*: One presentation of the stimulus.  \n",
    ">*block*: A sequence of trials of the same category. In the 'vdc' study, e.g. a block would consist of all face trials. Usually, multiple blocks are presented to the participant.  \n",
    ">*run*: A sequence of blocks presented to the participant. Typically an experiment will have multiple runs. There are a few reasons for this:\n",
    ">> *counter balancing*: If we started an experiment with faces, we want to also start with other categories to ensure there is no effect of the order of the category. This can be accomplished by having multiple runs, and manipulating the order of catgeories within runs.  \n",
    ">> *rest time*: Continuously performing a task can lead to fatigue. In fMRI studies, participants get to relax between runs.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">*TR*: Also known as Repetition Time. It is the time interval at which pulses occur and signal is collected. It can thus be considered as the sampling period of the BOLD signal. More details can be found here: https://mriquestions.com/tr-and-te.html\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Localizers*: Every person has a unique brain anatomy. Thus, it becomes difficult to pinpoint an exact location in an individual that would be preferential to a stimulus e.g. faces, based on a study with other individuals. We could make an approximate guess of the location, but that would only be approximate. To get the precise location of a brain ryegion in an individual that is sensitive to faces, we need to measure brain activity in that person when he/she is viewing faces. This helps localize the face preferred region in the brain of this individual and such experiments are called localizers. They are often used in conjunction with a main study to help localize a brain region preferential to a stimulus, in an individual, and this region is then used for further analysis in the main study. Localizers are typically block design experiments and are analyzed by contrasting the preferred stimuli with other stimuli. They are also used as independent determiners of the prefers stimulus to avoid circular inferences (more details will be covered in later notebooks). You can learn more about localizers here: \n",

In this dataset, found in the **'lab1'** folder of the dataset repository, we have two conditions (Face, Scene) of a single participant's data while they viewed short blocks of faces and scenes, respectively (well actually, this is simulated data to prove an analytic point, but the point is an important one!). Four runs of data were simulated. We extracted data for the two conditions from the PPA and averaged the activity of all the voxels in that ROI. In an initial analysis we looked at the mean PPA activity of both conditions after subtracting the baseline (activity when nothing was on screen) and found that the Face condition had greater activation than the Scene condition in this participant. We did this by taking the time point labels and averaging all time points belonging to each condition.\n",
